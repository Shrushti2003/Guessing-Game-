# Guessing Game Application

## About
This project is a C++ Guessing Game application where two players participate in a simple game of number guessing. The application provides an engaging interface where players can enter numbers, confirm their guesses, and track the number of attempts made to find the correct number.

## Purpose of the Project
The primary goal of this project is to create an interactive and fun game that demonstrates basic C++ programming concepts. It aims to offer a user-friendly experience where players can test their guessing skills and track their progress through an intuitive interface.

## Features
### Game Interface
- **Input Area**:
  - Players enter their guesses or the number to be guessed.
- **Confirm Button**:
  - Players use this button to submit their guesses or set the target number.
- **Attempts Tracker**:
  - Displays the number of attempts made to guess the correct number.

### Game Flow
- **Setting the Number**:
  - Player 1 inputs a secret number for Player 2 to guess.
- **Guessing Phase**:
  - Player 2 tries to guess the number set by Player 1.
- **Feedback Messages**:
  - Players receive feedback on their guesses (e.g., "Number too low", "Number too high", or "Congratulations, you guessed it!").

## Instructions
1. **Setting the Number**:
   - Player 1 enters a number between 1 and 10 and confirms the number to be guessed.
   
2. **Guessing Phase**:
   - Player 2 starts guessing the number. Each guess is submitted using the confirm button.
   
3. **Receiving Feedback**:
   - After each guess, feedback is provided:
     - "Number too low" if the guess is below the target number.
     - "Number too high" if the guess is above the target number.
     - "Congratulations! You won!" when the guess is correct.

4. **Tracking Attempts**:
   - The number of attempts is displayed, starting from 0 and increasing with each guess.

## Example Usage
- **Setting the Number**:
  - Player 1 enters: `7`
  - Player 1 confirms the number.
  
- **Guessing the Number**:
  - Player 2 guesses: `4`
  - Message: "Number too low"
  
  - Player 2 guesses: `8`
  - Message: "Number too high"
  
  - Player 2 guesses: `7`
  - Message: "Congratulations! You won!"
  
  - Total Attempts: `3`

## Conclusion
The Guessing Game application provides an entertaining way for users to engage in a classic number guessing game. It highlights fundamental programming principles while offering a simple, interactive experience. The game encourages players to use logical thinking and problem-solving skills to guess the correct number.
